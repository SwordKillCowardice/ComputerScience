sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
I tested three txt files of size 50,000, and found that sort1 has a large difference in
running time when the files are sorted and unordered, while for the complete reverse order
and random order in the unordered files are about the same, which is consistent with the time
complexity characteristics of bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
For the same file size of 50,000, whether ordered or not, it shows high performance and
takes about the same amount of time.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
For the same file size of 50,000, whether ordered or not, it shows normal performance and
takes about the same amount of time.
